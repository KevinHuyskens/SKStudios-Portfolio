                <p>Hi,
                    <br> my name is Kevin Huyskens, I'm a 22 year old Unity3D developer from Belgium. I graduated a year ago with an Academic Bachelor in Communication & Multimedia Design - Game Art & Design.
                    <br>I'm currently working for a company called <a href="http://www.enriched.be" class = "enriched-link" target = "_blank">Enriched.</a>
                    This is an AR/VR company that focusses on AR/VR simulations and training. In my free time I'm developping games and trying to start up my own game studio. I also like to do some web development (like this website you're looking at right now), and some mobile development.
                </p>

                <h3>Supernova</h3>
                <h6>Game dev</h6>
                <p>Supernova was one of the largest tech events in Europe. They asked us to develop a VR game for it. We decided on creating a VR space shooter. it involed multiple waves of enemies and at the end a big boss. What the player didn't know at the start tho, was that there was a second player with an iPad helping him. The player with the iPad could view the space in AR. So in essence the game was an AR/VR multiplayer experience. It was a huge success at Supernova.
